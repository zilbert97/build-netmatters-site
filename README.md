My HTML and CSS review

## Detailed to-do (besides the obvious):
- [ ] Go through selectors and properties, check usable with caniuse.com
- [ ] Consider condensing media queries
- [x] Prevent overflow in cards section
- [ ] Remove transition from Hamburger
- [x] Obtain assets and intgerate into site
- [ ] Research and integrate best practices for accessibility
- [x] Check right arrow and search icons are correct
- [ ] Remove background from page title logo
- [ ] Remove bootstrap function from jumbotron
- [ ] Search icon is too small - look to change or increase size while maintaining 23px font size
- [ ] Update button-base-style mixin to check whether the value passed to the "service" parameter is a key in the "nm-services" map
