## Notes to reviewer
- JS has been compiled to ES5 without comments - see js/uncompiled for commented and documented code.
- Due to being on Mac, my initial HTML/CSS reflection was completed with limited IE testing and several IE bugs present (lack of ability to test was considered at submission). Since then i've been able to test on IE and have tried to fix all major HTML/CSS issues not relating to this reflection, but some other bugs may persist.
